## USER STORY
AS A website developer
I WANT TO have a personal website that is easy to navigate and appealing to look at
SO I CAN demonstrate my skills as a developer to potential clients and employers.

## Assignment 2 - Bootstrap Portfolio
For my second assignment with Trilogy Education Services, I recreated my portfolio website using Bootstrap's grid system and components. This project reinforced topics covered during weeks 1 & 2 of the bootcamp. The goal was to learn how to navigate Bootstrap to use in professional proof of concepts as well as to further develop CSS skills.

With this project, many of the issues I'd faced in assignment #1 were much easier to overcome. The footer and navbar both were simpler using a combination of Bootstrap components and flexbox/Bootstrap's grid system. The form in contact.html also took very little time to complete, whereas the same contact page took hours to complete in the first assignment.

That being said, certain elements proved even more challenging this time around. The gallery in the portfolio still needs extensive work, as well as the alignment of the content boxes on all three pages. I also struggled with matching the given images with varying widths. The website is responsive, but not in the way I want it to be.
